    "description": "At first glance the South African game 30 Seconds looks a bit like Trivial Pursuit. Players play in teams of two. Every turn, a player takes a card with five famous names on them, and tries to describe those names to his partner, who tries to guess what is being described. The goal is to guess as many words as possible in, you guessed it, 30 seconds.",

Sure, under normal circumstances, it's easy to give an example of a frozen food or a dog breed, but you'll find that your brain works a little differently under pressure! To play, draw and reveal a card from the center pile. Does the symbol on your card match one on another player's card? If so, you must quickly face-off with the other player by giving an example of the person, place, or thing on his card before he can do the same for yours. If you blurt out a correct answer first, you win his card and the drawing continues.",
