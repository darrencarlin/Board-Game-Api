    "description": "At first glance the South African game 30 Seconds looks a bit like Trivial Pursuit. Players play in teams of two. Every turn, a player takes a card with five famous names on them, and tries to describe those names to his partner, who tries to guess what is being described. The goal is to guess as many words as possible in, you guessed it, 30 seconds.",
